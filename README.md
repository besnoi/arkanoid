Many breakout/arkanoid style games have been written in Love2D (like nooway's arkanoid game, coltonscopy's breakout to name a few) and they are good but all of these were written to demonstrate how game mechanics work. But this game was particularly written to demonstrate how powerful anima can be. For starters Anima is an "easy to learn and use" 2d Animation Library (not the usual animation library like anim8) written in Lua for the beloved Love2D framework (head on to https://github.com/YoungNeer/lovelib/Anima if you are interested)

## How to run the game

First of all extract the assets you can use winrar or the rar command (I donot remember the rar command so sorry you will have to figure that out on your own if you are on linux/mac) and then run "love ." or you could run the game in castle if you are on windows/mac

## Development

Well this game is pretty much complete, i think there were some minor bugs which i fixed before uploading and right now i donot think it needs any other extra feature (I added all the powerups i could think of) but still i encourage you to go creative and see if you can improve the project in some manner. One thing you can do is improve the collision detection system. Currently it uses a *very basic* collision detection system that doesn't work well for corner case so I'd be happy if you improve that.
